# Buildkite for GCE
This repo contains everything you need use buildkite on GCE.


## Use docker to build the image
1. Run `make build`
2. Get a cup of coffee
3. disk.raw.tar.gz should be created


## Without docker
1. Make sure you download and place `alpine-virt-3.8.0-x86_64.iso` in this folder
2. Make sure you have installed expect, qemu and mkisofs
3. run create-vm.exp
4. Get a cup of coffee
5. disk.raw.tar.gz should be created

Then upload disk.raw.tar.gz to your google bucket (and import it to gce afterwards)
